Changes

1.  Effective dates are now displayed for upcoming hours and hours exceptons.
      Upcoming regular hours now display a message Effective on start_date underneath the title.
      All exceptions display effective from start_date to end_date under the title
      All print pages display effective form start_date to end_date reguardless of if they are regular or exceptions or if they are upcoming or not.

2.  Exceptions display dates have been changed to show the exception 9 days before start date of the exception.  This is to clairfy confusion between what should be entered in the dates section.  Dates are now always the dates that the exception or regular hours run from.  Regular hours continue to be published 2 weeks in advance to the change.

3.  Wording change.  Along with item 2 the text "published dates" in the form and listing pages have been changed to just "dates" and help text has been updated accordingly.

4.  Bug fix:  the example display of the hours on the edit page did not have the updated display styles this has been corrected.

5.  There is now a link to edit the basic information about a service point.  It is "hidden" on the right at the bottom after you click on the title of a service point.

QA ideas

Do all testing on:
  http://factotumpprd.library.nd.edu/availability/service_points

Library test websites:
     all sites have a test website with the word test after the first section for example.
     Hesburgh -  http://wwwtest.library.nd.edu/
     Engeneering - http://engineeringtest.library.nd.edu/
     and so on.


1.  add upcoming regular hours and see the date on the current hours display on the service_point hours page and on the website.



2.  add an upcoming hours exception thats start date is 8 days from now and verify it shows up on the public site and in the current hours section.


3.  Check over the working changes on the service point hours page and to the help text.
   a).  http://factotumpprd.library.nd.edu/availability/service_points
   b).  Click on a service point.


4.  go to the service point edit page (number 5 above).  I am not convinced that this page is something that we really want to publish.  Fill it out and make sure it saves and goes to a page that makes sense when it is done.


5. Go over some of the old functionality and make sure it is still working.
